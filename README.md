My projct is a simple RepiceBook "RezetBuch", Which consists of 6 different classes **CookInstruction**, **Database**, **Ingeredient**, **Recipe**, **RecipeManager** and **RecipeBook** which is implemented in **Main.py**.The project also contains functionality such as **Insert** , **Delete** , **Update** , **Delete** , **View all Recipes**.<br><br>
