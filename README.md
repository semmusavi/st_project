# Advanced Software Engineering/ Musavi
This repository contains my project files and here in **README.md** you can find the description of my project software engineering metrics.<br><br>

My projct is a simple RepiceBook "RezetBuch", Which consists of 6 different classes **CookInstruction**, **Database**, **Ingeredient**, **Recipe**, **RecipeManager** and **RecipeBook** which is implemented in **Main.py**.The project also contains functionality such as **Insert** , **Delete** , **Update** , **Search** , **View all Recipes**.<br><br>


For this project I used **Python** as Programming language and **Sqllite3** as my database for store and retrival. For this project I used console as showing the result.<br>


## 1. Git/Github 
I used Git and Github which is used for version control, storing and tracking code to frequently commit and push my code to GitHub. At the very first beginning I did a pull but I did everything in my IDE my local code base was always up-to-date. My git times can be seen at the [contribution chart](https://github.com/semmusavi?tab=overview&from=2024-03-01&to=2024-03-01) in my GitHub.<br><br>

## 2. UML Diagrams
For this Project I created 4 different UML diagrams in the following you can find the links to diagrams <br>
  1. [UseCase Diagram](https://github.com/semmusavi/st_project/blob/main/UML/Usecase_Diagram.png) it is to present a graphical overview of the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals and any dependencies between those use cases.<br>
  2. [Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/semmusavi/st_project/blob/main/UML/Sequence_Diagram.png) here it is shown how processes operate with one another and in what order <br>
  3. [Class Diagram](https://github.com/semmusavi/st_project/blob/main/UML/Class_Diagram.png) here you can see the structure of a system by showing the systemâ€™s classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.<br>
  4. [Activity Diagram](https://github.com/semmusavi/st_project/blob/main/UML/Activity_diagram.png) shows the flow between different activities<br>

## 3. DDD 
here is the [link](https://github.com/semmusavi/st_project/blob/main/UML/DDD.png) to my DDD diagram.<br>

## 4. Metrics
I used SonarCloud which is Online of Sonarcube. For this I have connected my Github repository with it to analyse the source code of my project automatically.
