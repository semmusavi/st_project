# Advanced Software Engineering/ Musavi
This repository contains my project files and here in **README.md** you can find the description of my project software engineering metrics.<br><br>

My projct is a simple RepiceBook "RezetBuch", Which consists of 6 different classes **CookInstruction**, **Database**, **Ingeredient**, **Recipe**, **RecipeManager** and **RecipeBook** which is implemented in **Main.py**.The project also contains functionality such as **Insert** , **Delete** , **Update** , **Delete** , **View all Recipes**.<br><br>


For this project I used **Python** as Programming language and **Sqllite3** as my database for store and retrival. For this project I used console as showing the result.<br>


## 1. git 
I used Git and Github which is used for version control, storing and tracking code to frequently commit and push my code to GitHub. At the very first beginning I did a pull but as I work alone and I did everything in my IDE my local code base was always up-to-date. My git times can be seen at the [contribution chart](https://github.com/semmusavi?tab=overview&from=2024-03-01&to=2024-03-01) in my GitHub.<br><br>
